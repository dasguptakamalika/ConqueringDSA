* This problem counts **subarrays only**, not subsequences.
* **Subarray = contiguous elements** (next to each other).
* **Subsequence = can skip elements**, but that’s **not counted here**.
* Examples we discussed (`[2,3]` in `[2,3,1]` or `[3,0,2]` in `[1,3,0,2]`) are **subarrays** because elements are contiguous.
